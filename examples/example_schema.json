A total of 240 participants were randomly assigned to receive either metformin (1000mg twice daily) plus a structured exercise program and dietary counseling, or standard care alone. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c levels from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included fasting blood glucose, body weight, and quality of life scores. Results showed a significant reduction in HbA1c levels in the intervention group (mean decrease of 1.8%) compared to the control group (mean decrease of 0.5%, p<0.001). The intervention was well-tolerated with minimal adverse events. These findings suggest that combining metformin with lifestyle modification is an effective and safe approach for managing Type 2 Diabetes in middle-aged adults.",
